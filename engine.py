* Remove anything from the text above which doesn't look like natural language, smooth it out.
* Words which are wrapped on the next line and hyphenated i.e. morpho-
phonology should become "morphophonology"
* All references to figures or tables should be removed
* All parenthesized text should be removed, e.g. "(Solar-Lezama et al., 2016)"
* Cover the entire input document above then terminate
* remove all unnecessary whitespace and carriage returns
* Only write responses in natural explanatory language, remove all mathematics, notations, symbols etc
* Remove any empty lines, or lines which only have a few words or symbols on them

This is the what the document will look like after you have completed the task:
